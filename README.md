# SerGIS Prompt Author

The SerGIS Prompt Author is a web-based program to create [SerGIS JSON Game Data files](http://sergisproject.github.io/docs/json.html) for [the SerGIS Project](http://sergisproject.github.io/).

Current version: 0.9

## Using SerGIS Prompt Author

The SerGIS Prompt Author is hosted at this URL: http://sergisproject.github.io/sergis-author/

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and open `index.html`.

## TODO

Action Editor:

- `SERGIS_JSON_Style` in javascripts/author-json.js

- Issue with "Add More..." for actions and then not being able to delete them
  - "Adding more for add action doesn't work if I hit add after already entering one"

- When creating a buffer action, make sure that the "objectName" that we're buffering has been created!
  - If it hasn't, then the SerGIS Client spews up a "Error: Invalid objectName!" alert


Other:

- Tutorial and help to show basic usage
- Click/dblclick on content/actions/whatever to edit them
- YouTube: take entire URL rather than video ID
