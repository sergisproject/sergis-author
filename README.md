# SerGIS Prompt Author

The SerGIS Prompt Author is a web-based program to create [SerGIS JSON Game Data files](http://sergisproject.github.io/docs/json.html) for [the SerGIS Project](http://sergisproject.github.io/).

Current version: 1.1

## Using SerGIS Prompt Author

The SerGIS Prompt Author is hosted at this URL: http://sergisproject.github.io/sergis-author/

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and open `index.html`.

## TODO

Action Editor:

- Ability to delete action parts that we added using "Add More..."
- When creating a buffer action, make sure that the "objectName" that we're buffering has been created!
  - If it hasn't, then the SerGIS Client spews up a "Error: Invalid objectName!" alert
- When drawing on the map, make sure that the "objectName" is unique!
- When showing layers, make sure that the layer name is unique
- When hiding layers, make sure that the layer group exists
- For either thing involving layers, MAKE SURE that the user provides... 1) a name, and 2) a REST URL
  (otherwise, the SerGIS Client will fail silently)


Other:

- Tutorial and help to show basic usage
- Click/dblclick on content/actions/whatever to edit them
- Replace "Prompt Index" with just "Prompt", which consists of a 1-based prompt number and its title.
- Make `overlay()` (i.e. no parameters to overlay) revert to the last open overlay, instead of none (unless it was previously none).
  - Maybe add parameter to force none, or vice versa, i.e. if we just pass `true`, then go back to the previous overlay.
- If we're in an editor but we don't actually change anything (i.e. onchange() is never called), then we don't need to save

New Stuff:

- Remove "goto" from the actions that you can do, and add a new dropdown under each choice called "Next Prompt" (which includes an option "end game", that could just add a "endGame" action instead of a "goto" action).
- Add support for conditional `goto`s
  - Have a function in the author to convert a string like `(varName >= 10 && var2 is empty) or var3 equals 0 || (varName is 12 and var5 is less than 18)` into a tree of SerGIS JSON Condition objects
  - When checking stuff with goto actions (i.e. findRelatedPromptIndexes), any prompts with conditionals that reference any of these prompt indexes must also be "marked"
- Add ability to show/hide the map on a per-prompt basis (will also require something new in the JSON Game Data format, and sergis-client)
- Add ability to buffer geodata in layers
- Ability to "sketch" a feature on a map (i.e. if we want to draw something; instead of entering points, allow drawing it on a map)
- Support new frontendInfo stuff ("basemap" array, "layers" stuff, etc.) and new removeLayers action
- For layers, auto-detect what type of layer (Dynamic, Feature, etc.) depending on the URL
- Add an ability to "clone" a layer that is added to the map (what we mean by this is that if you want to add the same combination of maps/layers to several prompts, it would be useful if they could be copied from one prompt to another, without typing in the same information repeatedly in different prompts)
- Also, same thing for drawn objects (i.e. polygons)
  - Maybe add a dropdown for this action, "Copy Previous: [________]"

New "Graph View":

- An alternative to the current "table view"
- Prompts are shown as a directed "graph", where the nodes are the prompts (each is shown with its title and basic content, and the choices)
- Each prompt choice is connected via an arrow to another prompt, indicating where it goes to next
- Make generic function to generate the full table row(s) for a prompt, so we can use it in "table view", and also put it in an overlay to edit prompt details when in "graph view"
  - We would need a param for whether to include the "Next Prompt" select dropdown (in table view)
- Ways to implement the actual view of the graph:
